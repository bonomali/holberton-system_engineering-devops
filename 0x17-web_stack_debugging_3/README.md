# 0x17. Web Stack Debugging 3
---
## Description

During this project I will learn:
- Being able to debug a webstack is essential for a Full-Stack Software Engineer, and it takes practice to master it. In this debugging series, broken/bugged webstacks will be concocted and the final goal is to come up with a Bash script that once executed, will bring the webstack to a working state.
